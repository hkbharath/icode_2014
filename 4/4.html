As many people could crack Gopals theory on G-Integers, he thought of finding
another theory, so that he can call himself a king of maths in UVCE again.

Gopals new theory is about <strong>G-Digit</strong>. Now those who challenge Gopal
get a number <strong>N</strong>, and the challenger need to find a <strong>G-Digit</strong>
for the given number.

Gopal defines the <strong>G-Digit</strong> as follows,

Lets say that we have a very big string constructed by concatinating all 
numbers from 1 to 999999999 (10<sup>9</sup>-1) called <strong>G-String</strong>. 
Starting part the <strong>G-String</strong> would look like this
"1234567891011121314151617181920...." (quotes for clarity)

<strong>G-Digit</strong> for a given number <strong>N</strong> exists if <strong>N</strong> is less than
or equal length of <strong>G-String</strong>. If <strong>G-Digit</strong> exists for a given <strong>N</strong> then, 
it is the digit in <strong>N</strong><sup>th</sup> position in <strong>G-String</strong>.

Help the challengers to break the Gopal's ego.

<strong>INPUT</strong>
First line of input contains <strong>T</strong>, number of testcases.
Each testcase contains <strong>N</strong>.

<strong>OUTPUT</strong>
For each testcase print the single line with <strong>G-Digit</strong> for a given <strong>N</strong>,

<strong>CONSTRAINTS</strong>
