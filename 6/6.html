The Indian bank issues coins in 4 denominations, Re.1, Rs.2, Rs.5 and Rs.10.

Given a limited supply of each of the above denominations, in how many ways can 
you sum them up to a total of Rs.N?

INPUT
The first line contains an integer T (number of testcases). Each testcase 
contains 2 lines.The first line contains integer N (sum to be achieved)A, B, C 
and D in the next line, each representing the number of Rs.1, Rs.2, Rs.5 and 
Rs.10 coins respectively.

OUTPUT
Output the number of ways in which we can achieve the sum N.

CONSTRAINTS
1 <= T <= 150
1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= A <= 10000
1 <= B,C,D <= 1000

SAMPLE INPUT

2
15
2 3 1 1
12
2 2 1 1

SAMPLE OUTPUT

2
2


EXPLANATION

In the first case we need to find the different ways to total to 15.
We can use one Rs.10 coin and one Rs.5 coin or one Rs.10 coin two Rs.2 coin 
and one Re.1 coin. Proceed similarly for the second case.
