This year Gopal is judging the Treasure Hunt event in IMPETUS 14. Gopal is not 
happy with that because he can't do any thing until the event completes and he 
does not enjoy being a judge to that event. Finally he thought of finding minimum 
time required for the competition of the event.

As a judge Gopal has following data,
There are <strong>N</strong> Teams participating in the event. There are <strong>M</strong> treasures
to be found. And contest ends when <strong>K</strong> teams successfully finds <strong>K</strong> treasures.
(each team should find single treasures and two team cannot find the 
same treasure).

Now Gopal rates the teams and treasures such that, the difference between 
rating of <strong>i<sup>th</sup></strong> treasure and the rating of <strong>j<sup>th</sup></strong> team 
gives the estimated time, in seconds, required for <strong>j<sup>th</sup></strong> 
team to find <strong>i<sup>th</sup></strong> treasure.

Now Gopal wants sleep till the competition ends. Help Gopal to find the minimum 
time, in seconds, for which he might sleep.

<strong>INPUT</strong>
First line contains <strong>T</strong>, number of testcases.
In each testcase,
The first line contains three integers - <strong>N,M,K</strong> separated by a single space.
Following <strong>N</strong> lines will contain a single integers <strong>R<sub>j</sub></strong>, denoting rating 
of <strong>j<sup>th</sup></strong> team (in order from 1 to N). The next <strong>M</strong> lines will contain single
integer <strong>R<sub>i</sub></strong>, denoting the ratings of <strong>j<sup>th</sup></strong> 
treasure (in order from 1 to M).

<strong>OUTPUT</strong>
For each testcase print a single line containing the minimum time for which Gopal 
can sleep

<strong>CONSTRAINTS</strong>
1 <= <strong>T</strong> <= 10
1 <= <strong>N</strong> <= 100
1 <= <strong>M</strong> <= 100
1 <= <strong>K</strong> <= min(N,M)
0 <= <strong>R<sub>j</sub></strong>, <strong>R<sub>i</sub></strong> <= 10<sup>9</sup>
max(<strong>R<sub>j</sub></strong>) &lt;= min(<strong>R<sub>i</sub></strong>)
