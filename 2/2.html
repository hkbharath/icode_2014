<h2>G-Integer</h2>
Gopal recently made a small research in mathematics. Now he thinks that
he is the king of maths in UVCE. Whenever somebody challenges Gopal, he 
gives a number <strong>N</strong> to that person and ask him to find a 
<strong>G-Integer</strong> for that perticular <strong>N</strong>.

Now according to Gopal <strong>G-Integer</strong> is an integer <strong>I</strong>, 
whose sum of all digits multiplied by <strong>N</strong> is equal to the same 
integer <strong>I</strong>.

For Example : 
   	G-Integer for 2 is 18, because 2*(1+8) = 18.
	G-Integer for 3 is 27, because 3*(2+7) = 27.
	
<strong>INPUT</strong>
First line consists of <strong>T</strong>, number of testcases.
Each testcase contains single integer <strong>N</strong>.

<strong>OUTPUT</strong>
For each testcase print the <strong>G-Integer</strong> for given <strong>N</strong>.
If there are multiple <strong>G-Integers</strong> for a perticular <strong>N</strong>
then print the smallest <strong>G-Integer</strong>.
If <strong>G-Integer</strong> doesnot exist for a given number then print <strong>"NOT EXISTS"</strong>
(quotes for clarity)
