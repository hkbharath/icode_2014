UVCEians have a nature of speaking in cryptic languages.They tend to even change 
an ordinary set of numbers into a cryptic set. With <strong>N</strong> = 5, an random arrangement 
of 5 numbers might look like 2,3,4,5,1.

UVCEians with their urge of being cryptic, represent this arrangement of numbers
as 5,1,2,3,4  where the <strong>i<sup>th</sup></strong> number is the position of 
the integer <strong>i</strong> in the original arrangement. However this technique 
was found to have a glitch!!

Some arrangements never changed, even after the crypting technique was applied. 
These were called "AMBIGUOUS" arrangement. 
for eg:the arrangement 1,4,3,2 is ambiguous, because its cryptic arrangement 
is also the same.

Your job is to find out whether a given set of numbers are ambiguous or not??

<strong>INPUT</strong>
The input contains several test cases.
The first line of each test case contains an integer <strong>N</strong>.
Then a arrangement of the integers <strong>1</strong> to <strong>N</strong> follows in the 
next line. There is exactly one space character between consecutive integers.

You can assume that every integer between <strong>1</strong> and <strong>N</strong> appears exactly 
once in the permutation.

The last test case is followed by a zero.

<strong>OUTPUT</strong>
For each test case output "ambiguous", if the arrangement is ambiguous,
else print "not ambiguous" in a single line.

<strong>SAMPLE INPUT</strong>

1 4 3 2

<strong>SAMPLE OUTPUT</strong>
